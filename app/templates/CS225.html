	<h3><font color = '#7E354D'> Maze </font></h3>

Created a maze using Disjoint sets. Initially an M x M square maze was created with M<sup>2</sup> cells. Each cell was modeled as a Disjoint set. Random sets were chosen and union'ed, which was equivalent to the wall breaking between the two cells and a path possible from one to the other. Walls were broken until every disjoint set was part of one union, which meant there was a path from every cell to every other cell and a solvable maze resulted. Path compression was implemented, which makes union and find doable in O(log*N) time, which is constant time. <br>

The maze was further solved, finding a path from top to bottom and drawing it out:

<h3> <font color = '#7E354D'> Quadtree Image Manipulation </font> </h3>

Github Repo  </a> <br> <br>
A bitmap image was read into a Quadtree pixel by pixel, with each leaf of the tree corresponding to a pixel. A parent node corresponded to the average of its four child nodes as shown: <br>  <br>

<a href= "static/images/CS225/Quadtree.png">
<img src="static/images/CS225/Quadtree.png" > </a> <br>

If you observe carefully, the blue root node of the tree corresponds to entire image, and contains the average of the 4 subnodes,  the nodes at the purple level of the tree correspond to the 4 subdivided cells of the image and so on. This was done recursively by starting at the leaves of the tree and then assigning values to parent nodes.

An image could be obtained back from its corresponding tree by finding the leaf corresponding to each pixel and drawing it out.

An advantage of such compression is that such a tree will take less space in memory than the bitmap image itself. However to view the image it'll have to be decompressed and obtained back from the tree.

We did some neat operations with the tree:

<h3> Prune </h3>
If an image has a certain area which blends pretty well into its surroundings (so in frequency domain one could say it has minimal frequency changes, and its log fft would be bland for that region), then its child nodes could be done away with (pruned) and the region could simply be represented by its parent node, to give an example: <br> <br>

After Pruning

</table> <br>

A tolerance value was used to decide to what degree a pixel had to be similar to its parent (and thus its neighbors) so as to be deemed redundant and pruned.

Here's the image with a higher tolerance value (and therefore pruned more): <br> <br>

Pruning with a higher tolerance
</table> <br>


<h3> Rotation </h3>

By swapping the four children of each node (which were termed ne, nw, se and sw), the image could be rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. <br> <br>

</table> <br>

<p> <b> <font size = "3"> Other Operations: </b> </font> </p>

We also had a function which returned the tolerance level needed to end up with a certain number of leaves in the tree, it was implemented by performing binary searches for all possible tolerance values and pruning the tree to try and reach the number of leaves expected. <br> <br>

<h2> <font color = '#7E354D'>Mosaic </font></h2>

Divided image into rectangular pixels, then mapped images retrieved from flickr to the rectangular sections of pixels in the source image. Selecting the appropriate tile image was done through nearest neighbor search on a KD-tree, which are useful for searching points in Euclidean space.  <br>
